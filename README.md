# Computer Networks Final Project

**Submitted by:** Avital Yohananov, Naor Anidjar

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for the Computer Networks course.
The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Traffic Analysis:** Simulation and encapsulation of network packets.
2. **Chat Application:** A client-server chat system using TCP sockets.

---

## 📂 Part 1: TCP/IP Traffic Analysis
In this part, we simulated Application Layer messages (HTTP), encapsulated them into TCP/IP packets using Python, and captured the traffic using Wireshark.

---

## 📂 Part 2: Chat Application
In this part, we designed and implemented a multi-client chat system.
The system allows users to register, connect to other users, and send private messages via a central server.
